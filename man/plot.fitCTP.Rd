\title{Plot of observed and theoretical frequencies for a CTP fit}
\usage{
\method{plot}{fitCTP}(x, plty = "FREQ", maxValue = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{'fitctp'}}

\item{plty}{Plot type to be shown. Default is \code{"FREQ"} which shows the observed and theoretical frequencies for each value of the variable; \code{"CDF"} and \code{"PP"} are also available for plotting the empirical and theoretical cumulative distribution functions or the theoretical cumulative probabilities against the empirical cumulative probabilities, respectively.}

\item{maxValue}{maxValue you want to appear in the plot}

\item{...}{Additional parameters.}
